graph3 - a 3D graphing program

very much still a work in process

Watch this space for news as it happens (maybe - no promises)

TODO:
    windowing - SFML
    widgets? - need to research possible to use with gtkmm, or sfgui
    muParser
    graph data structs
        dynamically resizable?
        support Cartesian, cylindrical, spherical, parametric
        generate model, then dump? keep only eqn and evolute as needed?
        look into getting norms from eqn - partial derivatives?
    texturing
    model display
        want to use modern OGL - shaders
    camera
        if using shaders, can't use glulookat
    config / keep most recent
        libconfig++

model generator(string eqn)
    muparser magic
    can muparser be run in parallel?

    loop over max-min / step size
        get coords
        calc texture coords
        normals
            either from eqn if possible, or from avg (will need to be a separate loop)
        
    build opengl model (how with shaders?)
