graph3 - a 3D graphing program

Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
graph3 is an interactive 3D graphing / plotting program.

It supports the following coordinate systems:
    Cartesian (z(x, y))
    Cylindrical (z(r, θ))
    Spherical (r(θ, ϕ))
    Parametric (x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v))
Multiple graphs can be displayed simultaneously (including graphs in different
coordinate systems) and may be differentiated by colors or textures.

There are 2 camera modes: An 'orbiting' camera, which allows you to rotate and
zoom on the graph, and a 'free' camera in which the camera can be moved and
panned. The camera is controlled with the WASD keys and clicking and dragging
with the mouse. These allow close inspection of any point on the graph.

A cursor is provided that may be moved around the graph using the arrow keys.
The coordinates at the cursor's location are displayed at the bottom of the
screen.

Graphs are rendered using a Phong lighting model and smooth shading. The graphs
are lit by 2 light sources: a point light at the camera's position, and a
directional light. Setting for both can be changed from the setting menu.
